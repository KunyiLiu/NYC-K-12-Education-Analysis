# NYC-K-12-Education-Analysis
## Introduction
In order to figure out the education condition in NYC and give some advice to policy makers and students and their parents on school selection and self-improvement, we expect to analyze some local schools’ and students’ datasets.
We concentrated on analyses of K-12 and senior education. We divided our assignment into three part:  
1) Students’ information visualization and analysis.   
2) Schools’ information visualization and analysis.   
3) Further analysis and suggestions.
